# Current State Analysis

**Based on Requirements**: [Link to requirement.md]
**Analysis Type**: [GREENFIELD (0→1) / ADDITION (1→N)]
**Analyzed**: YYYY-MM-DD

## What Exists Already

[Map requirements to existing code]

**Requirement from requirement.md**: [Quote requirement]
**Existing Implementation**: [Found / Not Found]

**If Found**:
- Location: [path/to/file:lines]
- Pattern: [How it's currently implemented]
- Reusability: [Can reuse / Must modify / Cannot reuse]

**If Not Found**:
- Status: Not implemented (greenfield for this requirement)

## Similar Patterns (1→N only)

**Pattern 1**: [Name]
- Location: [path/to/file:lines]
- Use Case: [What it does]
- Relevance: [How it relates to requirements]
- Reusability: [High / Medium / Low]

## Dependencies Identified

**Dependency 1**: [Name] - [Status: Exists / Needs Creation]
- Why needed: [From requirement.md context]
- Current state: [What exists today]
- File reference: [path if exists]

## Integration Points

**Frontend** (where new code connects):
- Create: [New files needed]
- Modify: [Existing files to update]
- Reuse: [Existing components/utilities]

**Backend** (where new code connects):
- Create: [New files needed]
- Modify: [Existing files to update]
- Reference: [Existing models/services]
