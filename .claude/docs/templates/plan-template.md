# Implementation Plan

## Goal

[What we're building - from current_state.md]

---

## Current State Summary

[Starting point - brief summary from current_state.md]

**Exists**:
- [Key existing components/features]

**Doesn't exist**:
- [What needs to be created]

**Dependencies**:
- [Prerequisites identified]

---

## Strategic Phases

### Phase 1: [Name] ([estimated time])

**Objective**: [What this phase achieves]

**Tasks**: [High-level - detailed breakdown in tasks.md]
- Task category 1
- Task category 2
- Task category N

**Dependencies**: [What must be done before this phase]
- [Dependency 1 or "None - can start immediately"]

**Validation Gates**: [How we know this phase is complete]
- [ ] Validation criterion 1
- [ ] Validation criterion 2
- [ ] Validation criterion N

**Estimated Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High]

---

### Phase 2: [Name] ([estimated time])

[Same structure as Phase 1]

---

### Phase 3: [Name] ([estimated time])

[Same structure as Phase 1]

---

### Phase 4: [Name] ([estimated time])

[Same structure as Phase 1]

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: [What could go wrong]
**Likelihood**: [Low/Medium/High]
**Impact**: [Low/Medium/High]
**Mitigation**: [How to prevent or handle this risk]

### Risk 2: [What could go wrong]
**Likelihood**: [Low/Medium/High]
**Impact**: [Low/Medium/High]
**Mitigation**: [How to prevent or handle this risk]

---

## Rollback Strategy

[How to undo changes if implementation fails or needs to be reverted]

**If Phase 1 fails**: [Rollback steps]

**If Phase 2 fails**: [Rollback steps]

**If Phase N fails**: [Rollback steps]

**Safe to rollback?**: [Yes/No - is this additive or does it modify existing code?]

---

## Success Criteria

[How we know the entire feature is complete]

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3
- [ ] Criterion N

## Notes

[Additional planning notes, alternative approaches considered, etc.]
